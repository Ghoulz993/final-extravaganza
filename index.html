                        <p>Here I will talk about some of the games that I have been playing recently. They are all different style of genres and have their own unique gameplay mechanics to them.
                            Usually, I prefer to play video games that are in the shooter category, but I do like to play other style of games as well. It is nice
                            to have a variety of games to play when you get bored of one type to move onto another.

                        <p>This section will be about some of the anime that I have watched recently. More specifically, it will be anime movies that I have watched
                            recently which have left a big impression on me. They are both movies that had come out this year which I had been eager to watch
                            since I heard about their production being made.

                        <p>Recently, I have not been reading light novels as much as I used to, but there are still some series that I have been wanting to catch
                            up on. In this section, I will be talking about two light novel series that I have enjoyed reading and will continue to read in the future.
