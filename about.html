        <p class="about-body">
            This will be a casual, informative type of website. The focus will be on pieces of entertainment that I have consumed.  
            The site will focus on three main categories: video games, anime, and light novels. The site will provide general knowledge 
            of the things along with my personal opinions on them. The purpose of this website is to share my thoughts and experiences 
            with others who may have similar interests as me. This website is purely for fun and to express my thoughts and opinions on the various
            forms of media that I enjoy consuming. It would be nice to have a connection with other people that may share similar interests and 
            possibly think about this as a recommendation to these titles that I will be talking about. If you are interested in any of these
            things, please feel free to check them out on your own time and experience them for yourself.
